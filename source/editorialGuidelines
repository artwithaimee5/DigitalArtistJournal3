## Encoding strategies and editorial policies

The following was referenced when creating a taxonomy. A separate file is desired for the taxonomy, 
which can be used to update as the project grows. While this is not an explicit published taxonomy, 
it is a way to assign meaning to items in the text that have meaning established elsewhere, which can 
be searched on at a later time. 

Categories used in this project thus far (note that some categories can be nested under each other, 
such as Lacan, and Bowlby under psychology):  
bio: Physiological processes which result in energy, fatigue, health, illness
dream: Related to dreaming, dream states, sleep 
immanence: Related to Gilles Deleuze's theory of Domain of Immanence
imaginarymachines: Related to a catalog of machine drawings and paintings that exist in the artist notebooks
psychology: Psychological concepts such as attachment theory 
consciousness: unconscious, subconscious, conscious layer
Lacan: Jacques Lacan, French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist
Zizek: Slavoj Žižek, philosopher primarly from lecture material 
Bowlby: John Bowlby, British psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, child development and attachment theory 
desire: related to the arc of desire and death drive

In an effort to organize the sections of the page the following types have been used under <encodingDesc>:
